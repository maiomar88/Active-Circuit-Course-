## Active Circuits and Filters

This course  teach me operational amplifiers (op amps) and how to use them to design analog filters. i learned about the different types of filters, how to analyze their frequency response, and how to design them using op amps analtically and simulations

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, i'm able to:

* Understand the basic principles of op amps
* Analyze the frequency response of analog filters
* Design analog filters using op amps
* Realize any Circuit by op-amps FDNR,inductor,resistor 

## Course Outline

The course will cover the following topics:

* Introduction to op amps
* Basic filter types
* Frequency response of filters
* Design of filters using op amps
